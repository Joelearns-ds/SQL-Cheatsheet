# SQL Cheat Sheet: Intermediate - LIKE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY

| Command | Syntax | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LIKE** | `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;` | The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. Two common wildcards are `%` and `_`. | `SELECT f_name, l_name FROM employees WHERE address LIKE '%Elgin,IL%';`<br/>This command outputs entries with "Elgin,IL" in the Address. |
| **BETWEEN** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;` | The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range (inclusive). It can be used with numbers, text, or dates. | `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000;`<br/>This generates records of employees with salaries between 40000 and 80000. |
| **ORDER BY** | `SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;` | The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. Default is ascending. Multiple columns can be specified for sorting. | `SELECT f_name, l_name, dep_id FROM employees ORDER BY dep_id DESC, l_name;`<br/>Displays first name, last name, and department ID of employees, first sorted in descending order of department IDs and then alphabetically by last names. |
| **GROUP BY** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name(s);` | The GROUP BY clause is used with the SELECT statement to arrange data with identical values into groups. | `SELECT dep_id, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY dep_id;`<br/>Returns department IDs and the number of employees in each department, grouped by department IDs. |
| **HAVING** | `SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition;` | The HAVING clause is used with GROUP BY to filter data based on a condition after grouping. | `SELECT dep_id, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY dep_id;`<br/>Returns department IDs and the number of employees in each department, grouped by department IDs. |
